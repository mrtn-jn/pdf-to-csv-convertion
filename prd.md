## 8. Risks & Open Questions

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Bank format changes break parsers
  - *Mitigation*: Version detection, fallback parsers, monitoring alerts
- **Risk**: PDF parsing library limitations
  - *Mitigation*: Multiple library fallback (pdfplumber → PyPDF2 → camelot)
- **Risk**: Memory issues with large PDFs
  - *Mitigation*: Streaming processing, page-by-page extraction

### Business Risks
- **Risk**: Legal concerns about financial data processing
  - *Mitigation*: Clear data retention policy, compliance review, user consent
- **Risk**: Competition from established players
  - *Mitigation*: Focus on Latin American market specialization

### Open Questions
- Q: Should we support credit line statements or just credit cards?
- Q: How to handle multi-currency cards (USD/local currency)?
- Q: Should we store parsing templates for faster processing?
- Q: Integration priority: QuickBooks, Xero, or SAP first?
- Q: Should we build ML model for unknown bank format learning?

### Dependencies
- pdfplumber library compatibility with Latin American PDF encodings
- Availability of sample statements from all target banks
- Legal review of data processing requirements per country
- Cloud infrastructure provisioning for scale requirements
